# Dataset Generation

Repo to generate a small dataset for analysis elsewhere.

The output of this repo is a set of CSVs that detail the predictive outputs of a Mobilenet network and a VGG19 network. 

Cat images are sourced from the [fast.ai](www.fast.ai) tutorial - namely, their `dogscats.zip` dataset, locatable [here](http://files.fast.ai/data/dogscats.zip).
